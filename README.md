# future-day-website

This repository was created for the Future Day at the Ratsgymnasium Wolfsburg ([RGW](http://www.ratsgymnasium-wolfsburg.de/)) on April 27, 2023.

The purpose was to show the 14-year-old teens how easy it is to create a website.

The topic for the website - `French Revolution` - was chosen in terms of preparing for the school exam.
